## What Do You Want Built?

I want the foundational infrastructure for BuildPlan set up so we can start building features. This includes:
- PostgreSQL database (managed cloud service - NOT Docker)
- Prisma ORM configured
- Row-Level Security (RLS) for multi-tenancy
- Basic authentication system
- PM2 process management (already set up)

Essentially, complete Phase 0 and Phase 1 from the BUILD_PLAN_ROUTE_BY_ROUTE.md document, but skip Docker - we'll use a managed database instead.

---

## Why Do You Need This?

This is the foundation that all other features depend on. Without it, we can't build any user-facing features. It's blocking all other work.

---

## Who Is This For?

Development team - infrastructure work that enables everything else.

---

## Success Criteria

- PostgreSQL database accessible (cloud-hosted - Supabase)
- Connection string configured in .env
- Prisma schema defined with all core models (Organization, User, Request, Plan, Task, etc.)
- RLS policies working and tested (data isolation between orgs)
- JWT authentication implemented
- Can create a user, log in, and see data only for their organization
- Apps run via PM2 (already working)

---

## Constraints

- Must use PostgreSQL managed service - Supabase
- Must use Prisma ORM
- Must implement Row-Level Security
- NO Docker - run directly on VPS with PM2
- Should follow the route-by-route build plan

---

## Context

This is our first sprint. We're building the foundation. The VPS already runs PM2 successfully. We just need the database layer and app structure.
